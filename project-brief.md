# LAP 2 PROJECT BRIEF

## Organisation

### Duration

*1 Week*

### Set-up

*Students need to be placed in groups for the project. Ideally, there would be at least 4 students in a group.*

## Learning objectives

*The project is designed to encapsulate everything that has been covered so far on the course in order to create a tech solution that assists the council in addressing at least one of their resident's problems.*

## Brief

### Overview

You will be working in small teams to create a community app for a local council.

### Deliverables

- Stakeholder & solutions analysis
- High level solution diagram
- Wireframes
- Functional, deployed, MVP of your proposed solution
- Presentation

### Problem Statement

The Florin County Council have a number of issues. Like every county council they are having to do more with less and government cuts are biting hard. The council is increasingly having to rely on community involvement and to think of creative solutions to keep valued public services running. The council has asked a number of developer teams to come up with a tech solution for a problem that stakeholders in the local community are facing.

### Stakeholder Statements

**S.Morgenstern, Chief Executive Officer, Florin County Council**

_“Florin has so much going for it and we have fantastic public services everywhere. Unfortunately, cuts are becoming increasingly severe and this means that many of our public services are now under threat. It is vitally important to us as a council that we pull together as a community in order to ensure that the very services that have contributed so much to our vibrant and cohesive society can still play an active role in sustaining this.”_

**Residents**

_”It is inconceivable to me, that the very institution that honed my cunning, crafty, and clever mind, should now face closure. Staffing the library is becoming increasingly difficult, at the very point when more people are wanting to use our services.”_ 

_”The local recycling centre is overflowing with stuff that can still be reused, Why do people do this? I'm pretty confused."_ 

_"There is much skill in the local community. Knowledge and crafts have been handed down, generation to generation, but now much of this knowledge is not being shared as regularly, and, as a result, is in danger of being forgotten."_ 

_"Florin is surrounded by swathes of beautiful countryside, where many great and legendary historical events have taken place. Unfortunately, much of this is becoming increasingly destitute and our local landscape is becoming unrecognisable."_

### Technical Guidelines

- Use version control & work in an Agile manner!
- Your repos should have excellent READMEs. See our [Writing READMEs guide](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/Writing-READMEs) for details.
- Your work should make good use of the concepts we have covered so far on the course such as architectural thinking, stakeholder analysis, working methodologies, logical reasoning, databases, authorization (and associated tools), and broad accessibility principles.
- Your MVP should make good use of the technologies we have covered so far on the course such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node, and SQL.
- You must utilise a database.
- A signup/login system should be implemented.
- Your app should be deployed and you should aim for test coverage of at least 60%.

### Presentation Requirements

- Prepare a 10 minute presentation covering the following topics *(this is alphabetical, not an appropriate delivery order!)*:

    - Purpose of Solution
    - Planning & Delivery
    - Live Demonstration
    - Technologies
    - Significant Code / Code you are proud of (include snippets!)
    - Test Coverage
